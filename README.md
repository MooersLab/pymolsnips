# pymolsnips

A library of PyMOL scripting language code fragments has been reformatted for several popular text editors.
Some editors take snippet libraries in one file. 
Other editors require that each snippet resides in a separate file. 
The user downloads the desired file or folder and reinstalls the snippets following the protocol for that particular editor.

Snippet categories:

- Alternate locators
- Change orientation
- Color scheme
- Coordinate covalent bonds
- Electron density
- Fetch file from PDB
- Format label
- H-bonds
- Label format
- Label placement
- Label position
- Measurement surface area
- Molecular representation
- Print coordinates of selection
- Print sequence
- Specialized figure
- Stereo


Videos that demonstrate the installation of the snippets for each editor are planned.

<h2>Text editors that require some configuration and the install of additional packages</h2>
These text editors may take many hours to customize to fit your needs; however, you only need to 
know about 5% of the options to become productive with these editors. 

<h3>Sublime Text 3 (Universal)</h3>

This is my defult gui-based editor for many reasions.
The free trial period is infinite. 
I bought a license after several months because I thought that the software was worth it.
Sublime Text 3 starts up much faster than the other text editors for coders.
Sublime Text 3 strongly supports writing in LaTeX.  
It provides previews of figures and math equations from within a tex document before compiling it to pdf.
Sublime Text 3 has strong support for snippets and autocompletion.
Documents can be compiled on the fly and the bug reporting is more helpful than in most platforms. 

Move the folder **st3pymolsnips** to **~/Library/Application Support/Sublime\ Text\ 3/Packages/User/snippets/**.
You may have to create the snippets subfolder. 
You can ignore that step and just move **pymolsnips** to **~/Library/Application Support/Sublime\ Text\ 3/Packages/User/** and it should still work.
Restart Sublime Text, open a PyMOL pml script file, and then enter "ao" and  hit tab.
16 lines of code should appear.
You may need to install a snippet manager package and add an autocompletion package to be able to get autocompletion of the tab triggers and a description of the snippet. 

<h3>TextMate (Mac only)</h3>



<h3>Visual Code Studio (Universal)</h3>



<h3>Atom (Universal)</h3>




<h2>Text editors that are ready out of the box</h2>


<h2>Terminal based text editors</h2>
In this cateogry, vim is the most powerful editor followed by emacs and distantly by nano.
