# pymolsnips

A library of PyMOL scripting language code fragments has been reformatted for several popular text editors.
Some editors take snippet libraries in one file. 
Other editors require that each snippet resides in a separate file. 
The user downloads the desired file or folder and reinstalls the snippets following the protocol for that particular editor.

Videos that demonstrate the installation of the snippets for each editor are planned.

**Sublime text 3**
This is my favorite gui based editor. 
It starts up much faster than the other text editors for coders.
Move the folder **pymolsnips** to "~/Library/Application Support/Sublime\ Text\ 3/Packages/User/snippets/".
You may have to create the snippets subfolder. 
You can ignore that step and just move **pymolsnips** to "~/Library/Application Support/Sublime\ Text\ 3/Packages/User/" and it should still work.
Restart Sublime Text, open a PyMOL pml script file, and then enter "ao" and  hit tab.
16 lines of code should appear.
You may need to install a snippet manager package and add an autocompletion package to be able to get autocompletion of the tab triggers and a description of the snippet.
