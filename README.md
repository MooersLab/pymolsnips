# pymolsnips

A library of PyMOL scripting language code fragments has been reformatted for several popular text editors.
Some editors take snippet libraries in one file. 
Other editors require the each snippet resides in a separate file. 
The user downloads the desired file or folder and reinstalls the snippets following the protocol for that particular editor.
